  title: "Project Overview",
  paragraph: "This project is a text-based RPG inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, where an AI played the role of the Dungeon Master, dynamically creating stories and gameplay for users. It was developed as part of an innovation competition and involved a multidisciplinary team, including frontend developers, fullstack developers, .NET developers, and DevOps engineers. My role as a frontend developer and UX designer was to design the user interface and implement the game flow, ensuring an engaging and intuitive experience for players. ",

const problemAndSolution = {
  title: "Problem & Solution",
  paragraph: "Traditional tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons are popular for their storytelling and collaborative gameplay. However, they often require a skilled Dungeon Master to craft immersive narratives and manage gameplay, making it challenging for casual players to enjoy the experience without extensive preparation or expertise. Also, we think that the existing digital RPG platforms lack the creativity and adaptability of human DMs, which can turn into a repetitive or predictable experiences. This gap highlights the need for an innovative approach to delivering personalized, AI-driven RPG experiences that are accessible and engaging for players of all skill levels. So to address that shortcoming, we wanted to create a dynamic and accessible role-playing game experience for users without the need for a human Dungeon Master, while maintaining the creativity and unpredictability that make RPGs engaging.",

      title: "User-Centered Design Approach",
      description: "I took responsibility for creating an engaging interface with a smooth, understandable, and usable flow while ensuring it appealed to the gamer community. To achieve this, I conducted user research through interviews with 8 individuals and a survey answered by 29 gamers highly engaged in RPGs. The insights revealed a strong preference for a clearer, less cluttered character info, background, and stats window, greater customizability, and appreciation for AI integration. Additionally, new players to Dungeons and Dragons-like games struggled with understanding the mechanics and how to get started. These findings heavily informed our design choices."
    },
    {
      title: "Wireframing and Prototyping",
      description: "In the initial wireframing phase, I focused on addressing user pain points by creating a clear starting point and flow. The prototype began with an introduction to the Dungeon Master, followed by character creation. Users could choose from three options: creating a character manually, generating one using an integrated AI model, or selecting an existing character. If the AI option was chosen, users could specify character preferences and optionally provide a backstory prompt. Once character creation was completed, the game transitioned to text-based gameplay through an AI-powered chatbot. The AI Dungeon Master narrated the story, guided actions, and presented choices, while the chatbot stored the story for saving and resuming the game later."

      title: "AI Integration and Testing",
      description: "In collaboration with .NET developers, DevOps, and full-stack developers, we successfully integrated AI into our system. The AI powered the Dungeon Master's storytelling and gameplay mechanics, offering a dynamic and immersive experience. Following integration, we conducted extensive testing to ensure functionality and user satisfaction."

      title: "Tools & Frameworks",
      description: "We used a combination of Figma for wireframing, React.js for the frontend, Node.js for backend development, and Agile methodology to coordinate our large team of 12. GitHub was essential for code management, while Notion and Discord facilitated project organization and communication."
